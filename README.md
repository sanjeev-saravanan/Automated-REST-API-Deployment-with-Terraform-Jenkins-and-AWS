# Automated REST API Deployment with Terraform, Jenkins, and AWS üöÄ

This project focuses on **automating the deployment of a REST API application** using **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning and **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipeline management. The infrastructure is built on **AWS** and is designed to be **secure, scalable, and highly available**.

---

## Overview üåü

The project automates the following:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:
   - Uses **Terraform** to create a secure and scalable AWS infrastructure.
   - Provisions resources like **EC2 instances, RDS databases, VPC, ALB, ACM certificates, Route 53, and more**.
   - Stores Terraform state remotely in an **S3 bucket** for collaboration and reliability.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Uses **Jenkins** to automate the deployment of the REST API application to EC2 instances.
   - Ensures seamless updates and rollbacks for the application.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning AWS resources.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
- **AWS Services**:
  - **EC2**: Hosts the REST API application.
  - **RDS**: Managed database for the application.
  - **VPC**: Isolated network environment.
  - **ALB & Target Groups**: Load balancing and traffic routing.
  - **ACM**: SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.
  - **Route 53**: DNS management.
  - **S3**: Remote Terraform state management.
  - **Security Groups**: Ensures secure access to resources.

---

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Automated Infrastructure**: Terraform scripts to provision and manage AWS resources.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment process.
- **Scalable and Secure**: Designed for high availability and security using AWS best practices.
- **Centralized State Management**: Terraform state stored in an S3 bucket for team collaboration.
