Automated REST API Deployment with Terraform, Jenkins, and AWS üöÄ
This project focuses on automating the deployment of a REST API application using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline management. The infrastructure is built on AWS and is designed to be secure, scalable, and highly available.

Overview üåü
The project automates the following:

Infrastructure Provisioning:

Uses Terraform to create a secure and scalable AWS infrastructure.

Provisions resources like EC2 instances, RDS databases, VPC, ALB, ACM certificates, Route 53, and more.

Stores Terraform state remotely in an S3 bucket for collaboration and reliability.

CI/CD Pipeline:

Uses Jenkins to automate the deployment of the REST API application to EC2 instances.

Ensures seamless updates and rollbacks for the application.

Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning AWS resources.

Jenkins: CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

AWS Services:

EC2: Hosts the REST API application.

RDS: Managed database for the application.

VPC: Isolated network environment.

ALB & Target Groups: Load balancing and traffic routing.

ACM: SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.

Route 53: DNS management.

S3: Remote Terraform state management.

Security Groups: Ensures secure access to resources.

Key Features ‚ú®
Automated Infrastructure: Terraform scripts to provision and manage AWS resources.

CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment process.

Scalable and Secure: Designed for high availability and security using AWS best practices.

Centralized State Management: Terraform state stored in an S3 bucket for team collaboration.

Setup Instructions üìù
Prerequisites
AWS Account: With necessary permissions to create resources.

Terraform: Installed and configured on your local machine.

Jenkins: Installed and running (can be on a local server or EC2 instance).
